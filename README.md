1.Navbar-  i used bootstrap navbar component and modified the component and also used a transition effect on focus on searchbar.
2.Sidebar-  i have devided the whole body using row and column and took a part of it for the side bar and for responsive design i made the sidebar with 100% and used simple hover effect
3.Header-  the rest of the column after sidebar is used to create 2 different rows 1 for headed and rest for body, now used simple row col to devide it equally and at the end i added the heading , vote and rating
@Extra- i have used the css variable for storing color code.

Hope you will like this idea ! Please share your feedback and also give some tips so that i can make this more optimized. Thank you
